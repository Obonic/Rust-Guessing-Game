Rust Guessing Game Tutorial 


This certainly isn't all that impressive.  I've only begun learning programing and this is only so I can better learn git and how it works with github.  
I used this tutorial (https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html) as a guide and edited a couple things that made sense to me to do so at the time.

feel free to make edits I guess? I'm still learning.
